Data analysis and plotting code for "Seasonal Carbon Budget Succession in Lake Erie’s Western Basin"
This is a collaborative project between the lab of Rachel Eveleth at Oberlin College and the lab of Rachel Gabor at Ohio State University.
The code for creating Fig 3, 6, 7, and 8, calculating CO2 flux and statistics (linear regressions and ANOVAs) are in Eveleth's Python notebook.
The code for creating Fig 2, 4, 5, and Table 1 are in Gabor's Matlab file.
